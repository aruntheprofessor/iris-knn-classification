# iris-knn-classification

What I Did:

Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.

Normalized the feature values to ensure fair distance calculations.

Implemented the KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.

Trained the model using the training data.

Tested the model and calculated accuracy.

Evaluated performance using a confusion matrix.

Visualized the decision boundaries to see how the model classifies regions of the feature space.

Experimented with different values of K to see how it affects model accuracy.
